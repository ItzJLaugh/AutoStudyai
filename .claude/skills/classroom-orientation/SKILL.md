# CordiaClassroom orientation

`CLAUDE.md` owns the rules (pipeline tracing, prompt rules, locked slideshow capture, `fly deploy`). `PRODUCTION_RELEASE_PLAN.md` owns release priorities. This skill is the operational map.

## Talking to the owner (Jackson)
- Jackson doesn't write code or use git terms; Claude/Codex write the code, Jackson prompts and tests. Explain in plain language: "the live version" not "main", "saved changes" not "commits", "old draft copies" not "stale branches".
- Say what it means for the product and what decision is needed, not the git mechanics.
- Jackson's model: code gets pushed to GitHub, then goes live (Vercel does it automatically; the backends need a manual deploy).

## Layout
- `extension/` — MV3 extension (`content.js`, `background.js`, `popup.js`, `asai-bridge.js`, `vendor/Readability.js`).
- `pptx-bundle/pptx-parser.js` — locked PPTX parser bundle; `backend/services/pptx_rendering.py` renders PPTX server-side.
- `backend/` — FastAPI on Fly (`main.py`, `routers/*`, `services/llm.py`, `services/text_processing.py`, `domains/*.json`).
- `web/` — Next.js pages router (Vercel auto-deploy on push to main).
- `supabase/migrations/` — timestamped SQL; no full schema baseline exists yet.
- `tests/` — Python `unittest` contracts + node contracts; `web/tests/*.mjs`.

## Verify before every push (mirrors `.github/workflows/release-checks.yml`, which runs on PRs)
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate   # system pip can't overwrite debian PyJWT
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
python -m unittest discover -s tests
npm ci && npm ci --prefix web
npm test                       # extension-*.test.cjs need Playwright's pinned Chromium; they fail in cloud sessions only (browser build mismatch) and pass in CI
npm run build --prefix web
```
Baseline (2026-09-26, main 416e039): 111 Python tests pass, 10/12 node tests pass (2 = env-only Playwright), web build passes. CI green on main.

## State snapshot (2026-09-26 — refresh when stale)
- Work lands mostly as direct commits to `main` (recent revert pairs for visual redesigns).
- Draft PR #23 (`claude/wonderful-faraday-1dp3p2`, drop legacy autostudyai.online CORS) is 12 behind; rebase before merging or its diff reverts newer main work.
- `feat/classroom-production-readiness` has 13 unique unmerged commits (RLS hardening, Tutor grounding, provenance) — likely superseded partly; needs owner decision.
- `master` is a stale May 2026 branch (2 unique commits); everything else is merged → safe to delete.
